Project title : Fawry<br>
We generated sping intializr by java 17 versioin and maven<br>
All team members has java 19 in their IDE<br>
We used intellij IDE to write the code<br>
To run the project:<br>
1- Run the program<br>
2- Go to postman<br>
3-Make a new request<br>
4-Click body
5-Click raw<br>
6-Click json<br>
7-Choose GET or POST<br>
8-if it's post -> write the paramaters names like this for example -> <br>
{<br>
  "username":"FCAI",<br>
  "password":"CU"<br>
}<br>
9-Write the URL
10-Click send
<br>
NOTE:There are functions you don't want to add the params like above example but you should write them like that in the URL -> 127.0.0.1:8080/Wallet/Add/50 <br>
the "50" in the last of the url is the amount the user need to add in wallet
<br>
the functions you want to use the second way is -> addMoneyToWallet ( in class WalletController) - addRequest( in class RefundController) - searchService ( in class Account Controller)
<br>
The other functions you can use the default way 
<br>
