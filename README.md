Project title : Fawry
We generated sping intializr by java 17 versioin and maven
All team members has java 19 in their IDE
We used intellij IDE to write the code
To run the project:
1- Run the program
2- Go to postman
3-Make a new request
4-Click raw
5-Click json<br>
6-Choose GET or POST<br>
7-if it's post -> write the paramaters names like this for example -> <br>
{<br>
  "username":"FCAI",<br>
  "password":"CU"<br>
}<br>
8-Click send
<br>
NOTE:There are functions you don't want to add the params like above example but you should write them like that -> 127.0.0.1:8080/Wallet/Add/50 <br>
the "50" in the last of the url is the amount the user need to add in wallet
<br>
the functions you want to use the second way is -> addMoneyToWallet ( in class WalletController) - addRequest( in class RefundController) - searchService ( in class Account Controller)
